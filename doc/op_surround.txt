INTRODUCTION                                    *op-surround-introduction*

An essential surround plugin written in Vim9.

The usage follows Vim idioms, adhering to the `<your_map>{motion}` pattern.
For example, `sa"iw` surrounds the word under the cursor with double
quotes, and `sa(fa` surrounds the text from the cursor to the next a
with parentheses— assuming you’ve defined such mappings (see below). It also
works in visual mode and it supports multi-byte characters.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                    *op-surround-requirements*

Vim 9.1 is required.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                            *op-surround-usage*

You must define your mappings using the `g:op_surround_maps` variable. This
variable should be a list of dictionaries and each mapping dictionary must
include the following keys:

- `map`: the key sequence that triggers the surround operation
- `open_delim`: the opening delimiter to insert
- `close_delim`: the closing delimiter to insert
- `action`: can be `'append'` or `'delete'`.

Example:
>vim
  # Set typical surroundings such as parenthesis, brackets, quotes, ...
  g:op_surround_maps = []
  for [open, close] in [("(", ")"), ("[", "]"), ("{", "}"),
      ('"', '"'), ("''", "''")]
    # Append mappings
    add(g:op_surround_maps, {
      map: $"sa{open}",
      open_delim: open,
      close_delim: close,
      action: 'append'})

    # Delete mappings
    add(g:op_surround_maps, {
      map: $"sd{open}",
      open_delim: open,
      close_delim: close,
      action: 'delete'})
  endfor
<
In the same way, you can define buffer-local surrounding maps through the
dictionary `b:op_surround_maps` followed by the command
`:OpSurroundMakeMappings`.

Note: If a mapping already exists, it will not be overwritten!
