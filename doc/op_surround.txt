INTRODUCTION                                    *op-surround-introduction*

Yet another surround plugin.

Differently from existing plugins, the motion here is applied to the end of
the mappings that you can define as you want. It also works in visual mode.
You can also define buffer-local mappings.
Repeat works out-of-the-box.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                    *op-surround-requirements*

Vim 9.1 is required.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                            *op-surround-usage*

You have to define mappings through the variable `g:op_surround_maps`. Such a
variable is a list of dicts, where the dictionaries keys are `map`,
`open_delim` and `close_delim`.

Example:
>
  g:op_surround_maps = [{map: "<leader>(", open_delim: "(", close_delim: ")"},
    {map: "<leader>[", open_delim: "[", close_delim: "]"},
    {map: "<leader>{", open_delim: "{", close_delim: "}"},
    {map: '<leader>"', open_delim: '"', close_delim: '"'},
    {map: "<leader>'", open_delim: "''", close_delim: "''"}
  ]
<
and use for example `<leader>(iw, <leader>[fa`, etc.
It also works in visual mode.

Along the same line, you can define buffer-local mappings through the variable
`b:op_surround_maps`. This is handy in case you want different mappings for
different filetypes.
Once you have defined `b:op_surround_maps`, you must run the
`:OpSurroundMakeMap` command to create the mappings.
